    "# Lab 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: The goal of this lab will be to get a Jupyter notebook running, build/visualize/measure some basic networks using XGI/NetworkX, and compute some basic statistics!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before we get started**:\n",
    "1. Make a BIOL4559homework repository on GitHub. Add Abhay Gupta (@AbhayGupta115) as a collaborator in the Settings tab on GitHub.\n",
    "2. In GitHub Desktop, make a branch titled `comp-activity-1`.\n",
    "3. Put this notebook in the repository.\n",
    "4. Create a conda environment titled `biol4559` by running `conda create -n biol4559 python=3.13`\n",
    "5. Activate your conda environment by running `conda activate biol4559`\n",
    "6. Download the requirements file from Canvas (in the `labs` folder under `Files`) and place it in the repository.\n",
    "7. Install the list of requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "8. Make your environment visible to Jupyter Notebook by running `python -m ipykernel install --user --name biol4559 --display-name \"Python (BIOL4559)\"` in the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After the completion of this lab**\n",
    "1. List the people with whom you worked on this lab.\n",
    "2. Make a pull request and title it \"Grade Computational Activity 1\".\n",
    "3. Assign @AbhayGupta115 as a reviewer.\n",
    "4. Submit the pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How you will be graded**\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity is out of 10 points. You will be graded on two things: completion, clear documentation, and correctness of your process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Completion (4pts)*: This is solely whether you attempted and completed all portions of the computational assignment.\n",
    "* *Documentation (4pts)*: Write comments above your code, describing what it does to demonstrate that you understand what the code is doing. ** Examples of good and bad documentation below.\n",
    "* *Correctness (2pts)*: Does your code run and produce the correct output?\n",
