    "## Why NumPy?\n",
    "Python lists are excellent, general-purpose containers. They can be “heterogeneous”, meaning that they can contain elements of a variety of types (for e.g. `l = [1, \"A\", 3, \"B\"]`), and they are quite fast when used to perform individual operations on a handful of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the data and the types of operations that need to be performed, other containers may be more appropriate; they can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and offer a high-level syntax for performing a variety of common processing tasks. NumPy shines when there are large quantities of “homogeneous” (same-type) data to be processed on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy uses arrays as its basic data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an array?\n",
    "In computer programming, an array is a structure for storing and retrieving data. We often talk about an array as if it were a grid in space, with each cell storing one element of the data. For instance, if each element of the data were a number, we might visualize a “one-dimensional” array like a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[ 0, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "A 2D array would be like a table or matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[[ 0, 1, 2, 3 ],\n",
    " [ 4, 5, 6, 7 ],\n",
    " [ 8, 9,10,11 ]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "A 3D array would be like a cube of data, or perhaps like a stack of tables or matrices (imagine you stack pieces of paper each with a 2D array on it). In general, an array can have any number of dimensions, so the fundamental array class is called `ndarray`: representing an \"N-dimensional array\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays have some restrictions:\n",
    "* All elements of the array must be of the same type of data.\n",
    "* Once created, the total size of the array can’t change (unlike lists, where you can append elements).\n",
    "* The shape must be “rectangular”, not “jagged”; e.g., each row of a two-dimensional array must have the same number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "When these conditions are met, NumPy exploits these characteristics to make the array faster, more memory efficient, and more convenient to use than less restrictive data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this document, we will use the word “array” to refer to an instance of `ndarray`."

    ">>> np.zeros((3, 4))\n",
    "array([[0., 0., 0., 0.],\n",
    "       [0., 0., 0., 0.],\n",
    "       [0., 0., 0., 0.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we can do the same with ones using the `np.ones()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> np.ones(2)\n",
    "array([1., 1.])\n",
    ">>> np.ones((2, 3))\n",
    "array([[1., 1., 1.],\n",
    "       [1., 1., 1.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even create an empty array using the `np.empty()` function. The values in the array will be whatever happens to already exist at that memory location, so they will be random and unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> np.empty(2)\n",
    "array([3.14, 42.]) # random values\n",
    "```\n",
    "Why would you use `np.empty()` over `np.zeros()`? If later you are going to fill every element of the array with a new value anyway, then using `np.empty()` is slightly faster because it doesn’t have to first set all the values to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an array with a range of values using the `np.arange()` function. This is similar to the built-in Python function `range()`, but returns an array rather than a list. The arguments to this function are the start value (inclusive), the end value (exclusive), and the step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> np.arange(10)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
